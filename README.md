# to-do_web_app
Hello there..!
I have built this web app for web development internship at Oasis InfoByte.
---> This is simple to-do web app built using HTML,CSS and JavaScript.
---> User can add task and delete them whenever they are completed.
---> Also if user want to mark the task as completed but not to be deleted, user can just click on that task to mark it as completed.
